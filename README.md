ðŸŽµ Music Player Web App
This Music Player is a fully responsive and interactive web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Designed with simplicity and style in mind, it lets users play, pause, skip tracks, and enjoy smooth audio playback right in the browser. The interface is clean, minimal, and intuitiveâ€”perfect for both desktop and mobile users.

ðŸ’¡ The project uses HTML to structure the player layout, CSS for styling and responsiveness, and JavaScript to handle all dynamic functionality. JavaScript controls include play/pause toggling, next/previous song navigation, updating the progress bar in real-time, and automatically moving to the next track when one ends. Every interaction is fast and fluid, giving users a smooth and enjoyable listening experience.

ðŸŽ¨ The UI is designed with a modern aesthetic using custom CSS styling. It includes hover effects, active states, and transitions for a polished look and feel. The layout adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring that the player works great on phones, tablets, and desktops. Icons and controls are easy to understand and interact with, even for first-time users.

ðŸš€ This project was created to practice and showcase front-end development skills using only vanilla technologiesâ€”no frameworks or libraries involved. It serves as a great foundation for beginners to understand how to build a real-world audio player from scratch and can be easily extended with features like playlists, shuffle mode, volume control, or even backend integration for dynamic track loading.
